# Some reflections on my 18th birthday

Disclaimer: It is not mere whining without reason.

I’ve gradually stopped obsessing over classes I classified as unnecessary and have immersed myself in books that sparked my interest in the past 2 years. I feel like the most rebellious one in a system that operates in a predictable (if not stifling) manner. Just like how some birds have an extra layer of ultraviolet-sensitive cells in their eyes, reading has given me an additional perspective to understand the world beyond what those around me perceive. I’m not sure whether I would regret dropping the chance to listen to and participate in those classes (and the same question occurred to me when I chose to attend the current school). But after all, these are the problems I may never find the answer to. I’m doing just fine.
